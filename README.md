# Solar-powered-smart-dustbin-with-image-processing-and-animal-repulsion
This study aims to optimize urban waste collection by utilizing a solar-powered, artificial intelligence (AI)-based smart waste collection system. This project aims to end the inefficiencies of conventional waste collection such as overflowing bins, stench, and toxic environmental effects. Waste compaction, odor control, fill level measurement and real-time indication, and an automatic lid system based on real-time image processing to rationally distinguish between humans and animals have been included in this system. Moreover, automated repulsion is enabled by AI-based animal identification. As a result of the integration of the system into the cloud, there is more sustainability, less operating cost, and cleaner city environments through efficient data handling, proactive collection, and real-time Short Message Service (SMS) notification.
